  # On my motherboard (Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd. X570S AORUS ELITE AX),
  # A sensor wrongly triggers after suspend, immediately causing the computer to
  # shut down. This service runs:
  # echo disabled > /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone1/mode
  # at boot to disable this sensor and prevent this problem, since it's likely a
  # hardware issue on the motherboard.
  # Note that this may cause a failure to detect an actual overheating problem,
  # since we are disabling the sensor.
